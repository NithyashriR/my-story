The first episode opens with a view of a full moon and tails swinging beneath it as a voice explains what happened supposedly long ago. As the scene moves down we see a full view of a big fox demon with nine tails that will be now referred to as the NineTails. The voice continues to explain about how strong the demon is and how the shinobis fought it. Meanwhile, we see a bunch of wounded shinobis fighting, as a giant frog with a long pipe appears, with a man standing on top of it to face the NineTails. The voice then continues to explain that this person sacrificed his life to defeat the NineTails, and this was the Fourth Hokage. Thus, the episode begins after this being set as the backdrop for your first episode with the opening song playing in the background
