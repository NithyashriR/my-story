The first episode opens with a view of a full moon and tails swinging beneath it as a voice explains what happened supposedly long ago. As the scene moves down we see a full view of a big fox demon with nine tails that will be now referred to as the NineTails. The voice continues to explain about how strong the demon is and how the shinobis fought it. Meanwhile, we see a bunch of wounded shinobis fighting, as a giant frog with a long pipe appears, with a man standing on top of it to face the NineTails. The voice then continues to explain that this person sacrificed his life to defeat the NineTails, and this was the Fourth Hokage. Thus, the episode begins after this being set as the backdrop for your first episode with the opening song playing in the background
The scene changes to our main character, a blonde boy of 12 years old running away from 2 pursuing shinobis with a bucket in his hand full of what looks like yellow paint. They started jumping all around the buildings in the town he's being chased through trying to escape them. The blonde boy then tells them all to shut up and explains how none of them could have done something this horrible, but he can, while we see close-ups of graffiti all over big heads sculpted from a mountain side. Some shinobi explain to an old man who is the Third Hokage (and the voice from the beginning of the episode) that Naruto (the blonde boy) has put graffiti all over the Hokage monuments.
